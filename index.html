      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>My unique background in environmental biology has allowed me to bring a multidisciplinary perspective to data science and has helped me to leverage data to solve complex environmental challenges.</p>
      <p>I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Environmental Biology from [University] and a Master's degree in [Major] from [University]. Throughout my academic and professional career, I have developed a deep understanding of statistical analysis, programming languages like Python and R, data visualization, machine learning, and spatial analysis.</p>
      <p>In my previous roles, I have worked on a range of data science and geo informatics projects. Some of my notable achievements include developing predictive models to understand the impacts of climate change on ecosystems, analyzing and interpreting data to inform environmental policies and regulations, and using geospatial data to identify and track endangered species populations.</p>
      <p>Apart from my technical skills, I am a fast learner, a clear communicator, and a team player. I believe in collaborating with experts from various fields to solve environmental problems and contribute to the development of a more sustainable future.</p>
