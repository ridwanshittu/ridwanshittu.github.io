      <h3>Hi! I'm Ridwan. </h3>
      <p>I am a researcher and data scientist currently focusing on global change ecology. My expertise lies in developing models to monitor and predict biodiversity changes using classical regression and machine learning approaches. Additionally, I have extensive experience mapping areas at risk of mosquito-borne disease transmission. With over half a decade of experience as a data scientist and geo-informatic analyst, I have worked in various domains, including ecological and environmental monitoring, digital health surveillance, finance, marketing, and tutoring.</p>
      <p>I am passionate about data and believe in the transformative power of Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning to improve people's lives and help companies achieve their goals. I strive to work efficiently in problem-solving, motivating individuals, and assisting companies by sharing my expertise and experience through writing, mentoring, and consulting to achieve success in environmental research and data science projects.</p>
